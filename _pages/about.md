Hello! Thanks for stopping by. I'm James.

I'm a second year Commerce and Computer Science student at UNSW. I'm aspiring to become a full stack developer, focusing on web and iOS development. I'm currently learning Swift and Kotlin and have back-end experience with Python, Java and Ruby. I'm currently employed as an admin by the Australian Electoral Commission, where I work with proprietary tools to maintain the integrity of the Australian electoral roll. Outside of work, my hobbies include mechanical keyboards, photography and swimming.

This personal website will eventually become a full-fledged, academic-focused portfolio page, with links to my repositories and projects... but for the time being, I'm planning on using it as a cataloguing/blogging space for my hobbies and extra-curricular activities.

The best way to reach me is by Discord or LinkedIn: you can find links to my profiles below!
