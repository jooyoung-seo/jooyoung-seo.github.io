The LZ Classic, or CLS, like its namesake, is an overly-plain, under-designed classic TKL that was run by LZ in early 2017.
It's main features are the relatively high typing angle of 10 degrees and the stainless steel plate that many opt as the default in their configurations.

The board is LZ's homage to the 2013 board OTD 456GT, which similarly features a very high typing angle (albeit a bit higher at 11 degrees), similar bezel ratios, and the box on wedge design language.

Three colours were offered in the original 2017 Group Buy: Black, Silver and Gray. A total of 83 units ended up being commissioned, and of these, 20 were black, and of these, 14 were Winkeyless variants. Making this specific unit on my desk 1 of 14 in the world. Interestingly, I also previously owned a silver WKL variant of which there were 13 units made. Sadly, that particular board was sold and I miss it dearly. For the CLS, you could also choose between a brass or stainless steel backpiece weight. This particular unit has a brass weight with some natural patina accumulated as well as some of LZ's personal fingerprints.
